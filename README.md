## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jtrfs/animal-trading-card/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jtrfs/animal-trading-card/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Project Instructions :octocat:
**Review the Animal Trading Cards project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/151/view).**

1. Download and unzip `fend-animal-trading-cards-master.zip`. Inside, you'll find `card.html`, `styles.css`, `placeholder.png`, and the `design-prototype.png`.

2. Next, open `card.html` and replace the placeholder image and information with your favorite animal's image and information. For the image, you will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Later, we’ll talk about how you can fix this problem using responsive images. Also, don't forget to change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, `alt="name-of-your-animal"` should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.

3. Once you've added your favorite animal's image and information, add the proper CSS to `styles.css` to recreate the design-prototype.png by applying the style rules in step 4. You’ll need to modify `card.html` to include attributes and use selectors to specify the elements you want to style. Also, make sure to link to your stylesheet in `card.html` or else your CSS will not be applied to your webpage.

4. The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:

  - italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
  - bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
  - no dots for the animal's list items
  - border around the animal's name, image, and information
  - border around the animal's information
  - spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
